# Introduction

This DUST API is organized around the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principle. The API has standard predictable resource-oriented URLs. It also accepts form-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. At last it uses the standardized HTTP response codes, authentication and verbs.
